                Hello there! I'm Daryl Andres, a passionate individual who became a web developer through self-study.
                I'm on a journey of continuous learning in the vast world of web development.
                While I may not have formal job experience in the field, my dedication have led me to
                create several personal projects that showcase my skills and love for coding.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-7">
                My journey in web development began with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, crafting small static websites to realize my ideas, driving me to delve deeper into the field; embracing Angular with Tailwind CSS for frontend development and Django-Python for backend functionality added robustness and dynamism to my projects. While leveling up my web development skills, I've recently started delving into web scraping with Python-Scrapy.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-7">
                Although I've been comfortable as an independent learner, I am ready and excited to transition into a more team-oriented, collaborative environment. I am more than willing to contribute my skills and knowledge to a team, absorbing insights from experienced professionals, and adding value to any project I undertake.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-7">
                Looking for a dedicated web developer ready to contribute and take on challenges? Look
                no further. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to your team.
