            <p class="scroll-reveal leading-7">
                Hello there! I'm Daryl Andres, a passionate individual who became a web developer through self-study.
                I'm on a journey of continuous learning in the vast world of web development.
                While I may not have formal job experience in the field, my dedication have led me to
                create several personal projects that showcase my skills and love for coding.
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-reveal leading-7">
                My journey in web development began with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, crafting small static
                websites to realize my ideas, driving me to delve deeper into the field; embracing Angular with Tailwind
                CSS for frontend development and Django-Python for backend functionality added robustness and dynamism
                to my projects. While leveling up my web development skills, I've recently started delving into web
                scraping with Python-Scrapy.
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-reveal leading-7">
                Although I've been comfortable as an independent learner, I am ready and excited to transition into a
                more team-oriented, collaborative environment. I am more than willing to contribute my skills and
                knowledge to a team, absorbing insights from experienced professionals, and adding value to any project
                I undertake.
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-reveal leading-7">
                Looking for a dedicated web developer ready to contribute and take on challenges? Look
                no further. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to your team.

                        In my role at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), I organized training sessions and
                        occasionally served as a speaker for entrepreneurial seminars.
                        Additionally, I provided assistance to MSME clients, guiding them through the business
                        registration
                        and compliance processes.

                        These engagements have honed my verbal communication, presentation, and effective speaking
                        skills,
                        allowing me explain complex technical ideas in an easy-to-understand way.
                        Also, my experience in project management during these roles has equipped me with the ability to
                        plan, execute, and coordinate tasks efficiently.

                        One of my passions is playing the guitar; I'm particularly drawn to the energetic beats of
                        metalcore music, and you might catch me both listening to and occasionally strumming along.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leading-7">
                        Beyond the strings, you'll find me hitting the gym to stay active and fit.

                    <p>
                        On the leisure side, I'm an avid anime enthusiast, with a particular fondness for series like
                        'One Piece'. And, I can't forget to mention my love for gaming—especially 'Call of Duty:
                        Mobile'.

                        I'm all about balancing my interests and enjoying life to the fullest.

                        fulfilling lifestyle – a mindset that I bring into my web development journey, ensuring that
                        each project is approached with passion, and dedication.
